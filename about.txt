    The Game of Life is a zero-player game created by John Conway. The game consists on an infinite grid where it's cells can be either alive or dead. Each cell follows a set of rules:

For living cells:
    - If the cell has 2 or 3 living neighbors, it stays alive in the next generation.
    - If the cell has only 1 living neighbor, it dies from isolation in the next generation.
    - If the cell has 4 or more living neighbor, it dies from overpopulation in the next generation.

For dead cells:
    - If the cell has exactly 3 living neighbors, it becomes alive in the next generation.

    Only this set of rules are enough to create complex and impressive patterns.
